        <text>You step into the thick darkness of the cave, lanterns held high, a thin layer of mist between your feet. Ahead, the cavern wall becomes a steep slope, and you spot what seem to be mushrooms at the top of a high ledge. Do you attempt the climb, or continue searching the cavern floor?</text>
